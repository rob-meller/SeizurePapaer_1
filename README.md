Scripts used for RNA alignment for seizure study

The following scripts were used to convert Ion Torrent uBam files to fastq files, clean with trim-Galore, and then align to the Human Reference genome using 2-pass star and Bowtie2.  Scripts are designed to be run on ubam files from multiple chips. The final Samtools cript merges the data together.
